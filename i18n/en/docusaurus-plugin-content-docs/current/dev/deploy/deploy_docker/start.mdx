# Run Bot

After the configuration is completed, use 'Docker run' to run AkariBot:

```sh
docker run \ 
> -d \ 
> -v /path/to/akari-bot/config/config.toml:/akari-bot/config/config.toml \ # Please modify the path to the corresponding location.
> -p 11451:11451  \ # Please change the port of the WebSocket server according to your configuration file.
> -p 3306:3306  \ # Used for docking with MySQL databases. (Optional)
> --name=akari-bot  \ # Specify the container name.
> bakabaka9/akari-bot
```

If a container of the `long_tag` type is returned in the terminal, it is proven that the container has been created, and then we can perform the `docker logs akari-bot` to view the AkariBot's log.

If there are no errors reported, congratulations!Your AkariBot has been deployed successfully!
