# Download Source Code

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId='operating-systems'>
<TabItem value="win" label="Windows" default>
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="c1" label="Clone with Git" default>
```

1.  Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

2.  Please right-click and open Git Bash in a folder to place an AkariBot and enter the following command: 

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Teahouse-studios/akari-bot.git
    ```

    Cloning at GitHub is slower. In exceptional cases, you can clone using a mirror station:

    ```sh
    git clone https://gitclone.com/github.com/Teahouse-studios/akari-bot.git
    ```

    :::info

    The mirror station will update the repository every night, so please use the original GitHub address if you want to get the latest version of the code before the mirror station is updated.

    :::

3.  Press `Shift` + `Right-click` and open the terminal.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="c2" label="Download code directly">
```

    :::info

    We are no longer providing downloads for Releases because we cannot guarantee stability in the Release version.

    :::info

    Direct downloading of code deployment is not recommended, as you will not be able to update the code using Git or using the bot built-in command.
