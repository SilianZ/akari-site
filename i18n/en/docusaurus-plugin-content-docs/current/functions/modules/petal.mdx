This module gets the number of valves for the current group, which can be used for the [`ask`](ask) block.

## `petal`

Use：`~petal [<group ID>]`

This command gets the number of valves for the group in which it hits and the number of peers from other groups if it has superuser permissions.

## `petal modify`

Use：`~petal modify <Quantity > [<Group ID>]`

This command can modify the number of valves for the target group and change the number of valves for the group if the ID is empty.
