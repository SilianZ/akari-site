# Abuse Warning

Abuse of command is a violation of[服务条款](policy).Frequent use of robots not only affects normal chat, but may also cause robot accounts to be controlled.

Thus, in order to protect the stability of the service, small States may automatically warn against acts that may pose a threat to the service and may blacklist users after a certain number of warnings have been exceeded, disregarding any messages they have sent.

## Abuse Warning

We have the following limit to use commands in 5 minutes：

-   The same command cannot be used more than 10 times.
-   Different commands cannot be used more than 20 times.

If the limit is exceeded, you will be warned 1 times and will be temporarily banned for 5 minutes.

## Blocks

All messages sent will be ignored during the temporary blocking.Attempting to continue using the command 5 times during this period increases the number of warnings.

When warning reaches 5, it will be blacklisted.Users on the blacklist will not be answered with any messages.

If you are a developer, you can change the maximum number of times in[配置文件](development/config).
