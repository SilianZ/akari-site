# Multilingual Guides

## Introduction

This normative document is designed to ensure the consistency and format of the multilingual version of the project.Please follow the following in order to preserve the consistency of multilingual resources in the repository.

## File Location

Please place the language file in the `/locales` directory and name it as a JSON file.

The directory under the root path is used to place the global string. The directory under the module is used to place the corresponding block string.

In principle, the module string and corresponding module must correspond to, except, if there is a connection between the block, otherwise consider converting to a global string.

## Language File Format

Make sure the key name corresponds to the string and cannot be nested.

**Global strings names**：`strings class.uses`

**Name of the module string**：`Module name.string class.(command name.)uses`

使用 `${变量名}` 可表示变量，变量名须使用英文，不建议使用 Python 语句，禁止使用空格和特殊符号，如需分隔则请使用下划线代替。

## Use Example

Example： to call multilingual strings in module help

```py
from core.component import module

test = module('test', desc='{test.help.desc}')

@test.command('say <word> {{test.help.say}}')
...
```

Example： to call multilingual strings in code

```py
from core.builtins import Bot

async def test(msg: Bot.MessageSession):
...
    await msg.send_message(msg.locale.t("test.message.say.prompt")) # 没有变量时可直接输出
    await msg.send_message(msg.locale.t("test.message.say.reply", sender=msg.target.sender_id)) # 若存在变量，则须将变量赋值后输出，如此处在字符串内的变量为 ${sender}，并被赋值为 Bot.MessageSession.target.sender_id
```

## Layout specification

This section refers to[中文文案排版指北](https://github.com/sparanoid/chinese-copywriting-guidelines), which may be inconsistent.

:::

Too long there is no space separated between：and full angular symbols (except for punctuation points) that correctly use punctuation and terminology in the corresponding language.

### Spaces

#### Additional spaces between English and English

Correct：

In IBM research, they have developed an advanced voice recognition system using AI technology.

Error：

> In IBM research, they developed an advanced voice recognition system using AI technology.

Exceptions：are written in conventional formats, such as name, product name, etc.

#### Space added between Chinese and number

Correct：

> This year’s global automobile sales have reached 800,000.

Error：

> This year the global sales of vehicles have reached 80 million.

#### No spaces between numbers and units

Correct：

> My fibre-optic intake has 10 Gbps wide and the SSD has 10 TB.
>
> The average annual rainfall in this city is 1,200 mm.
>
> Angles of 90° angle are corners of angle.

Error：

> My fibre-optic intake has 10 Gbps wide and the SSD has 20 TB.
>
> The average annual rainfall in this city is 1200 mm.
>
> Angles with a angle of 90° are straight angle.

#### Additional spaces between variables and Chinese

The input of the variable is usually English or numeric and therefore a space must be added between the variable and the Chinese.

Correct：

> You threw a stone out of $\\1 count}

Error：

> You threw a stone under $\\1 count}.

Exceptions：can be empty if the variable is entered in Chinese.

#### No spaces between full corner points and other characters

Correct：

> I just bought iPhone, fun!

Error：

> Just bought iPhone, fun!

#### Half Corner Spaces Related

If there are other characters after the half-corner point (except for the left quote, left parentheses, etc.), add spaces.

If there are other characters before reference points such as the left quote, left parenthesis and so on, add spaces.

No spaces around the set and the connection number (hyphen).Additional spaces are required before and after the dash (dash).

More than one half corner points must be seen together as one punctuation, and do not separate them in space.

Correct：

> The sun set over the horizon, casting a warning glow on the city. As night fall, the lights began to twinkle, creating a captivating skyline.
>
> The physical threat was said to be idden deep within the ancient cavern... guarded by myical threats and protected by an ancient spell.
>
> The story — with its strong windows, torrential rain, and less thunder — lasted for homes, leaving behind a trail of destruction.
>
> "Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans." People always said.
>
> I end to the bookstore yesterday and look for a new novel (the one I've was wanting to read for months).

Error：

### Punctuation

#### Don't repeat punctuation

While the repeated use of punctuation symbols is permitted in the norms, it undermines the seriousness and beauty of the sentences, and do not.

#### Do not use quotes in English

Error：

> In the serene moonflit night, whispers of ancient tales lingered, echo through the stilness of time…

### Full and Half Corners

#### Use full corner punctuation

Correct：

> Hi!Do you know?My movie in the front office today told me "Momo" Oops!

Error：

> Hey there! You know you? Today the little sisters in the front office say "Mom" Oops!
>
> Hi ! You know you? My little sister in the front office today says "Mom" Oops!

#### Semi-angular characters for numbers and English

Correct：

> This cake is only $200.

Error：

> This cake is only $200.

#### Use the Half Point in the full English text

> What is Jobs saying?“Stay hungry, day foolish”.

### Terminology

#### Correct case for proprietary terms

Correct：

> Sign in with GitHub

>
> Sign in with github
>
> Login with GITHUB

#### Do not use informal abbreviations

Error：

> We need a FED, familiar with Js, h5, and at least one framework (e.g. backbone, angular, RJS etc.).

### Regional words in Chinese from different regions

Don't use wrong regional words such as “videos” in traditional Chinese. This is not a joke.
