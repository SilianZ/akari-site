import Asciinema from "@site/src/components/Asciinema";

# Run robot

Use `docker run` to enable smallï¼š after configuration has finished

```sh
docker run
> -d
> -> -> -> v /path/to/akari-bot/config/config.toml:/akari-bot/config/config. oml # Please change path to the corresponding location.
> -> -> p 1145:11451 # The port of the WebSocket server, Changes based on your profile.
> -> 3306:3300\# for touching the mysql database. (optional)
> --name=akari-bot\# Specify the container name.
> bakabaka9/akari-bot
```

If a container of the `long_tag` type is returned in the terminal, it is proven that the container has been created, and then we can perform the `docker logs akari-bot` to view the loggable log.

Congratulations, if no error occurred!Your small cocoa robot has been built successfully!
