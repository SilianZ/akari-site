# Run robot

The small cocoa robot consists mainly of platform robots. In order for developers to better test modules, we have also provided a test console, and we will then show how to run the robots.

## Run Platform Robots

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="win" label="Windows" default>

We do not recommend double clicking on `start.bat` to start the program.

It is recommended to open the terminal (cmd or Powershell) before running `start.bat`.

1.  Open Terminal in `start.bat` directory.
2.  Enter `./start.bat` (Powershell) or `start.bat` (cmd) in the terminal to start the robot.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

1.  In the terminal, set the execution permissions of the `start` script：

    ```sh
    chmod +x start
    ```

2.  Launch script：`./start`.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Asciinema
    url="https://asciinema.org/a/605774.cast"
    options={{
        theme: "monokai",
        poster: "npt:21.5",
        cols: 100,
        rows: 30,
        idleTimeLimit: 0.25,
    }}
/>

## Run Test Console

The test console includes a basic operating environment in which you can use the command to perform the underlying robotic interaction within the test console.

The test console only supports replies to text messages and images. Other message elements will be ignored or converted to text or image to show.

:::info

You may need to switch to a Poetry virtual environment using `potry shell` to call the previously installed dependencies.

:::

1.  Open Terminal in `console.py` directory.
2.  Enter `python console.py` in the terminal to start the test console.
