<TabItem value="c1" label="使用 Git 克隆" default>

1.  Right-click to open the terminal in the folder, where you want to place it, and enter the following directive：

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Teahouse-studios/akari-bot.git
    ```

    GitHub clone is slower. In exceptional cases, you can clone： using mirror stations

    ```sh
    git clone https://gitclone.com/github.com/Teahouse-studios/akari-bot.git
    ```

    ```sh
    git clone https://gh-proxy.com/github.com/Teahouse-studios/akari-bot.git
    ```

    :::info

    The mirror station will update the repository every night, so please use the original GitHub address if you want to get the latest version of the code before the mirror station is updated.

    :::

2.  Open Terminal in a folder.

    ```sh
    cd akari-bot
    ```
